This npm package allows you integrate [prismjs](https://prismjs.com/) into a svelte website. Prismjs is a library for displaying code on webpages. I have example repositories showing how to use it with Sapper and Routify. You can find out more by clicking hte github link. I am always open for pull requests. :)
