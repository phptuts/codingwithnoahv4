Hi! Iâ€™m Noah Glaser, a web developer and computer education instructor in Oakland, California. I currently teach at the Berkeley Code School.

My passion is both teaching people of all ages how to code and building fun software programs to help them learn along the way. Most of my classes are free or online.
