Hi! I’m Noah, a [professional web and mobile developer](/#experience) and computer education instructor in Oakland, California. If you are interested in a one on one lesson please email me at glaserpower [@] gmail.com.  When time permits I also do some freelance web and iOS development.  I currently teach at [noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge) and [ace makerspace](https://www.acemakerspace.org/)

My passion is both teaching people of all ages how to code and building fun software programs to help them learn along the way. Most of my classes are free or online. I specialize in teaching Arduino and hardware projects, like this [High-Five Machine](https://electroblocks.org/?lessonId=Gcym9zmref566fEFWgYy). I also teach all-level classes in web development, which you can find for free on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjWnee4Cv1MESU8ALLsHdCA).

For my latest project, I built a drag-and-drop coding environment for learning how to program Arduino boards. It’s called ElectroBlocks, and it’s perfect for new programmers because it allows you to play the code you wrote back like you’re watching a video. Give it a try and tell me what you think :)

I’ve taught and assisted with all kinds of computer education classes at [Oakland Public Library](https://oaklandlibrary.org/locations/main-library), the [Dallas Maker Space](https://dallasmakerspace.org/), the [Austin Hacker Space](https://atxhs.org/), [The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment](https://www.themade.org/), and the [David E. Glover Center](https://www.degetc.org/) in Oakland.
