Hi! I’m Noah, a [professional web and mobile developer](/#experience) and computer education instructor in Oakland, California. My passion is teaching people of all ages how to code. I have taught Roblox, PHP, javascript, Svelte, React, SQL, and much more. If you are interested in private coaching/tutoring, you can [schedule a free 30-minute consult](https://calendly.com/glaserpower/tutoring-session-fit). I charge $75 per hour session. I work with students from ages 11 and up. My only requirement from students is a genuine desire to learn.  

I’ve taught and assisted with all kinds of computer education classes at [Oakland Public Library](https://oaklandlibrary.org/locations/main-library), the [Dallas Maker Space](https://dallasmakerspace.org/), the [Austin Hacker Space](https://atxhs.org/), [The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment](https://www.themade.org/), and the [David E. Glover Center](https://www.degetc.org/) in Oakland.
